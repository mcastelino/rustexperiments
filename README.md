My experiments when learning rust

# why

Rust to me feels like the alien language from the movie "Arrival"

"One of the most fascinating things about the heptapods’ communication system is that it’s non-linear. Their logograms are intended to be interpreted all at once – and they can be quite complicated. Chiang’s novella describes a logogram as being able to contain an arbitrary amount of information (words, sentences, paragraphs). "

"The beautiful implication of the heptapods’ language is that with whole sentences or paragraphs of language available for consideration at one time, heptapods might have a completely different way of thinking. With everything available at once, there is no forwards or backwards – directionality doesn’t exist. Though they still exist in time, time has a different meaning for them."

So all I am trying to do is make sense of rust with some small coherent example to which I can refer to later.
